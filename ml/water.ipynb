    "# ### Project Goal\n",
    "# To develop a highly accurate regression model that predicts the optimal volume of water required for a single irrigation event, based on the crop type, soil characteristics, and seasonal water needs.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### Novelty for Research\n",
    "# Instead of a simple lookup, we will use a **Gradient Boosting Regressor**. This advanced ensemble technique builds a strong predictive model by iteratively adding weak learner models (typically decision trees). Each new tree is trained to correct the errors of the combined existing ensemble, making it exceptionally powerful for tabular data.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# This approach allows the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships between the features (like crop and soil type) and the target (water volume), providing a more dynamic and intelligent recommendation than a static schedule. This methodology is well-suited for a research paper on smart irrigation systems.\n",
